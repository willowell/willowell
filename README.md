<summary>About Me</summary>
<p>
I'm a Full Stack Software Developer living in Toronto, Canada. I'm originally from the United States.

I've worked in Agile teams on the websites for beloved, highly respected, and wide-reaching Canadian national brands like Global News, Food Network Canada, and HGTV Canada, facilitating access for people across Canada to important local and national news, delicious recipes, cool D.I.Y. crafts, and more.

I develop solutions with fearless pragmatism, drawing upon and combining the best design patterns and programming paradigms to deliver delightful, accessible experiences for both internal and external users.

In my free time, I program for fun, exploring and learning about a wide array of technologies and topics, both new and old. I'm almost always learning something new. You can see that for yourself in my GitHub repositories and GitHub Stars! I love programming puzzles like Advent of Code, and I occasionally play around with game development.

When I'm not programming, I'm spending time with my amazing husband, playing with our adorable cat and dog, and getting lost in Elden Ring and Metroid Prime.

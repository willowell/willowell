# üòÉ Hello, bonjour!

  **Hello! My name is William Howell, and I am currently living in Toronto, Ontario, Canada** üá®üá¶ I'm an aspiring software developer with over 6 years experience in programming between my studies in college and programming as a hobby. At the end of 2019, I decided to make this my livelihood, get into web development, and take on larger, more serious projects. I'm currently volunteering with [Furnal Equinox](https://furnalequinox.com/) as their webmaster, and I am also responsible for the development of the website for Furnal Equinox 2021: Pixel Purrfect, which is an all-virtual event!
  
 ## üëã About Me
 
 <details><summary>Click to view!</summary>
  
  I actually started out computer programming with Khan Academy's Computer Programming course back in 2014! My first programming class in college used it as part of the course material. At the time, I did not view myself as a techy person. I was afraid I would do poorly because I did not get very far learning C++ a few years prior with the *Beginning C++ Through Game Programming* book. Much to my surprise, I had a blast! I had *tons* of fun in that first programming class, so much so that I went out of my way to learn Java and then C++ (properly this time with *Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++* and Xcode set up!) in my free time.
  
  Speaking of college, I studied Arts and Technology at the University of Texas at Dallas, which meant game development for me. My favourite classes related to my degree were my classes on Unity and the class I had on Autodesk Maya. I can't afford Autodesk Maya, so I use Blender instead. For what it's worth, I like Blender much more anyway. The UI is *much* cleaner and easier to understand. I feel tired just looking at Maya's UI ü§£
  
  I completed 98 credits towards my degree. I hope to pursue a degree in Computer Science in the near future.
  
  In my free time, I like to play with my cat and my dog, listen to music and podcasts, and play video games like Animal Crossing, Metroid, Mass Effect, Ratchet and Clank, and other platformer games like Super Mario Odyssey. I also enjoy cooking. I just wish it didn't take so long sometimes!

## Mini-Portfolio

<details><summary>Click to view!</summary>
  
  I intend for this section to accompany my pinned projects below. When I am done with my [personal website](https://github.com/willowell/williamhowell), I will move this information there.
  
### [virtual.furnalequinox.com](https://github.com/Furnal-Equinox/virtual.furnalequinox.com)

  The website for Furnal Equinox's virtual convention! This is an open source [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) website, written mostly in TypeScript and hosted on Netlify. It uses Netlify Functions to invite users who register through our RegFox pages. It also uses a Fauna database to track the total donation amount for the website's UI and for our event staff and to track how much each registrant has donated for our records and for giving perks and incentives. I invite you to check out the repository - this is just scratching the surface!
  
### [FE Donations Tool](https://github.com/Furnal-Equinox/donations-tool)

  This is a small React web app for our event staff to keep track of the total donation amount and to determine whether or not someone has donated.
  
### [Guessing Game](https://github.com/willowell/Guessing-Game)

  The classic number guessing game written in several different programming languages while preserving the semantics and structure of the game. I like revisiting this from time to time when I learn a new language.
  
### [DELISH! Client](https://github.com/willowell/Delish-Client) and [DELISH! Server](https://github.com/willowell/Delish-Server)

  This is DELISH!, an Allrecipes-like full-stack web application using Apollo GraphQL. I made this after following [this tutorial](https://moonhighway.com/apollo-datasources), which resulted in [this Apollo GraphQL server](https://github.com/willowell/Apollo-GraphQL-Server-for-REST-Countries). This was my first attempt at a serious project. I had a lot of fun making this web app and sharing it live with my family! It has a few problems, but I have largely solved these problems in virtual.furnalequinox.com, such as:
  * how to order the Bootstrap Sass files and override them,
  * how to share state between a search bar and the container for displaying search results,
  * and how to use flexbox, grid systems, margins, and padding to make a nice, responsive layout.

### [OGMTPS](https://github.com/willowell/Oh-God-Make-the-Puns-Stop-2)

  This is a theatre reservation command line application. I made the original version for the final project for my Computer Science 1 class back in 2015, and I revisited it in the fall of 2019 and rewrote it almost from scratch using C++17 and Microsoft's vcpkg. My Computer Science 1 professor had a thing for puns and dad jokes in the projects, so I named my project as a tongue-in-cheek response. I have included the original version for posterity. I wrote a reflection on version 2 on my WordPress blog [here](https://williamphowell.wordpress.com/2020/09/19/post-mortem-on-version-2-of-my-movie-reservation-program-in-c/). I also reflect on my path as a programmer since college in that post.

## üìñ Areas of Interest
 
* **Functional Programming**
  * Pure functions and isolating I/O interactions, particularly how they can help reduce the surface area for errors and bugs in codebases.
  * Careful state management, especially using PODs over classes to avoid hidden state, and passing state as a context or function argument instead.
  * Monadic error-handling (e.g., Rust's `Result` type) as a deterministic alternative to exceptions.
  * Simplyfying common expressions - especially loops - in imperative programming styles by rephrasing them as operations in FP; e.g., `sum $ map (\x -> x * 2) [1..20]` as a rephrasing of a for-loop that applies the function `f(x) = x * 2` to every member of `[1, 2, ..., 20]` and sums the resulting values.
  * ["Parse, don't validate"](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/)
* **Programming Language Theory**
  * The expression problem, and how different programming languages attempt to solve it
  * Programming language design and development
  * How one's programming language determines how one approaches a problem
  * How different languages approach and address similar problems
* **Web Development** 
  * React with hooks because I enjoy the declarative programming style.
  * TypeScript because it has great tooling and helps avoid a lot of JavaScript type errors. However, I appreciate its gradual typing system when I'm exploring APIs.
  * GraphQL because it provides a nice, uniform interface for some REST APIs, and it is typed and therefore integrates well with TypeScript.
  * I'm also curious about ReScript / ReasonML because ReScript (AFAIK) uses the Hindley-Milner type system. I find the idea of using a smaller language with a stronger, static type system very appealing!
  * I'm interested in Tailwind CSS because I appreciate its flexibility and utility-first approach. I'm also interested in Chakra UI because it is not as opinionated as, say, Bootstrap or Material UI. I'm exploring using Tailwind CSS in my WIP personal website.
* **Application Development (üõë on hold for now üõë)** 
  * I really like Swift 5 and SwiftUI. I'd like to explore developing a macOS desktop application with them sometime soon.
  * I love React, so of course, I'm very interested in React Native / Expo too. 

And other areas of interest:
* **Calculus**
  * I have lots of fun figuring out the solutions!
* **Quantum Computing and Quantum Information**
  * How its relationship with existing paradigms will evolve
  * I am very interested in the math and physics behind them
* **Photography**
  * Especially landscape and cityscape photography
* **3D Modeling**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Programming Languages

* <img alt="TypeScript" width="30px" src="assets/typescript.svg" /> **TypeScript**
* <img alt="Haskell"    width="30px" src="assets/haskell.svg"    /> **Haskell**
* <img alt="Rust"       width="30px" src="assets/rust.svg"       /> **Rust**
* <img alt="C++"        width="30px" src="assets/cplusplus.svg"  /> **C++20**
* <img alt="Python"     width="30px" src="assets/python.svg"     /> **Python**
* <img alt="Swift"      width="30px" src="assets/swift.svg"      /> **Swift 5**

‚ö†Ô∏è These are the languages I am *confident* in; I know and have tried many more languages than just these, but these are my go-to languages and the ones with which I feel comfortable enough to work. That is, I know enough to make a script or tool with the language, I know how to move around the documentation for the language and its libraries, but I may not know most or all advanced features or rarer / more obscure features of the language. ‚ö†Ô∏è

## üß∞ General Tools

* **Computer**: Late 2013 cylinder Mac Pro
* **OS**: macOS 11.2 Big Sur (of course...)
* **Text editors**: Visual Studio Code, a little vim
* **IDEs**: IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, CLion, Xcode, Visual Studio Code via language servers.

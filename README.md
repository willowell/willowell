### üòÉ Hello, bonjour!
----
  **Hello! My name is William Howell, and I am currently living in Toronto, Ontario, Canada** üá®üá¶ I'm an aspiring software developer with over 6 years experience in programming, but only recently have I decided to work on larger, more serious projects. I have experience with game development, application development, and web development, but most recently, I have been knee-deep in Haskell and having tons of fun wrapping my brain around pure functional programming, functors, monads, and how I can apply those concepts back to other programming languages, as you can see in my [GuessingGame repository](https://github.com/willowell/Guessing-Game).
  
  In my free time, I like to play with my cat and dog, listen to music and podcasts, and play video games like Animal Crossing, Metroid, Mass Effect, Ratchet and Clank, and other video game platformer games like Super Mario Odyssey. 
  
In particular, my areas of interest are:
* **Functional Programming**
  * Pure functions, particularly how they can help reduce the surface area for errors in codebases
  * Monadic error-handling as a sane, type-safe alternative to exceptions
  * Simplyfying common expressions in imperative programming languages by rephrasing them as operations in FP; e.g., `sum $ map (\x -> x * 2) [1..20]`
  * The IO monad, and how I can apply it to other programming languages
  * Dependent types (‚ö†Ô∏è in progress ‚ö†Ô∏è)
* **Programming Language Theory**
  * The expression problem, and how different programming languages attempt to solve it
  * Programming language design and development
  * How one's programming language determines how one approaches a problem
  * How different languages approach and address similar problems
* **Web Development** 
  * with React, TypeScript, and GraphQL
* **Application Development** 
  * with Swift 5 and SwiftUI (‚ö†Ô∏è in progress ‚ö†Ô∏è)

And other areas of interest:
* **Calculus**
  * I have lots of fun figuring out the solutions!
* **Quantum Computing and Quantum Information**
  * How its relationship with existing paradigms will evolve
  * I am very interested in the math and physics behind them
* **Photography**
  * Especially landscape and cityscape photography
* **3D Modeling**
  
  
### ‚öôÔ∏è Programming Languages

* **C++20**
* **Haskell**
* **Python**
* **Rust**
* **TypeScript**
* **Swift 5**

‚ö†Ô∏è These are the languages I am *confident* in; I know and have tried many more languages than just these, but there are my go-to languages and the ones I feel comfortable enough to make a production-ready application with. ‚ö†Ô∏è

### üß∞ Tools
----
* **Computer**: Late 2013 cylinder Mac Pro
* **OS**: macOS 10.15 Catalina (of course...)
* **Text editors**: Visual Studio Code, kakoune (‚ö†Ô∏è in progress ‚ö†Ô∏è)
* **IDEs**: IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, CLion, Xcode, Visual Studio Code via LSPs.

## Key Skills

A quick note: as listing my skills in terms of years of experience is inaccurate, I prefer to list my skills in terms of familiarity and proficiency, on a scale of:

1. Proficient (I can hit the ground running with this skill)
2. Intermediate (I understand *most* typical features and use-cases for this skill, but there is definitely a lot more room for improvement.)
3. Novice (I have used this skill once or twice in a real project or in a few tutorials, and I understand this skill in principle or by virtue of a similar technology, but I definitely need more research.)
4. Learning (I am actively learning this skill. My knowledge of this skill is somewhere between Novice and Intermediate unless appended to another level.)
5. Rusty (I have learned this skill in the past up to an Intermediate or Proficient level, but have not used it in at least a year. I will need time to brush up on these skills. Depending on the skill, there may be dormant muscle memory!)

> [!NOTE]
> Why is listing skills in terms of years of experience inaccurate?
>
> Computer science is a vast, diverse world and moves very quickly, and much like riding a bike, you lose what you don't use!
> 
> So, for instance, if I were to list "React (8 years)," that doesn't tell you how frequently or well-versed I am in it, or if I know class components and/or functional components. For all you know, I used it once or twice and then never again in 7 years!
> 
> Listing "React 17+ (proficient)" tells you what I am familiar with (React post advent of functional components) and how familiar I am with it (I can hit the ground running with it). You do not need to infer my proficiency level; I am directly attesting it here.

> [!WARNING]
> Please note: this list is not exhaustive! If you want to see *everything*, take a look at [the full list](/TheFullList.md).

## Junior Web Developer
Versatile, people- and detail-oriented with 1+ years experience. Loves learning, experimenting with, and staying up-to-date with web development and best practices. Strives to deliver a superior user experience and developer experience. Designs solutions with a data-driven, functional approach.

Developed a website for Furnal Equinox in collaboration with Art and Marketing that helped achieve their original donation goal of CAD$ 6000 and bring the community together for a virtual event. Regularly and candidly discussed website’s progress, requirement and budget changes, and feature feasibility with team and supervisors. Diagnosed and resolved most technical support requests, deferring to staff as needed. 

## Key Skills
A quick note: as listing my skills in terms of years of experience is inaccurate, I prefer to list my skills in terms of familiarity and proficiency, on a scale of:
1. Proficient (I can hit the ground running with this skill)
2. Intermediate (I understand *most* typical features and use-cases for this skill, but there are definitely places where I need more research.)
3. Novice (I have used this skill once or twice in a real project or in a few tutorials, and I understand this skill in principle or by virtue of a similar technology, but I definitely need more research.)
4. Learning (I am actively learning this skill. My knowledge of this skill is somewhere between Novice and Intermediate unless appended to another level.)
5. Rusty (I have learned this skill in the past up to an Intermediate or Proficient level, but have not used it in at least a year. I will need time to brush up on these skills.)
